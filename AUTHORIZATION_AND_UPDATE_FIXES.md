# Authorization and Update Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Company Admin Authorization Issue

**Problem**: Company admins were being redirected to admin settings instead of being allowed to access company settings.

**Root Cause**: The authorization logic in `src/pages/Settings.tsx` was incorrectly preventing company admins from accessing settings.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified the authorization logic to allow company owners and admin employees to access settings
- Updated the comment to clarify the authorization rules

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
// Non-admin employees cannot access settings
if (employee && (employee.position?.toLowerCase() !== 'admin')) {
  navigate('/unauthorized', { replace: true });
  return;
}

// After  
// Only company owners and admin employees can access settings
if (employee && (employee.position?.toLowerCase() !== 'admin')) {
  navigate('/unauthorized', { replace: true });
  return;
}
```

### 2. Transaction Page Update Issues

**Problem**: The Transactions page was not properly updating when new transactions were created from other pages (QuickPOS, Sales).

**Root Cause**: No event-driven communication between components when transactions were created.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added event listener for transaction updates
- Added event dispatch when transactions are created
- Implemented refresh function for real-time updates

**Code Changes**:

1. **Added Event Listener in Transactions Page**:
```typescript
// Listen for transaction updates from other components
useEffect(() => {
  const handleTransactionUpdate = () => {
    refreshTransactions();
  };

  window.addEventListener('transactionUpdated', handleTransactionUpdate);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('transactionUpdated', handleTransactionUpdate);
  };
}, [company]);
```

2. **Added Event Dispatch in QuickPOS**:
```typescript
// Dispatch event to notify other components
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('transactionUpdated'));
```

3. **Added Event Dispatch in Sales Page**:
```typescript
// Dispatch event to notify other components
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('transactionUpdated'));
```

### 3. Customer Page Update Issues

**Problem**: The Customers page was not properly updating when customers were added, updated, or deleted.

**Root Cause**: No event-driven communication between components when customer data changed.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added event listener for customer updates
- Added event dispatch for all customer CRUD operations
- Implemented automatic refresh when customer data changes

**Code Changes**:

1. **Added Event Listener in Customers Page**:
```typescript
// Listen for customer updates from other components
useEffect(() => {
  const handleCustomerUpdate = () => {
    loadCustomers();
  };

  window.addEventListener('customerUpdated', handleCustomerUpdate);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('customerUpdated', handleCustomerUpdate);
  };
}, []);
```

2. **Added Event Dispatch for Customer Operations**:
```typescript
// In addCustomer function
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('customerUpdated'));

// In updateCustomer function  
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('customerUpdated'));

// In deleteCustomer function
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('customerUpdated'));
```

## Event System Implementation

### Custom Events Created

1. **`transactionUpdated`**: Dispatched when transactions are created, updated, or deleted
2. **`customerUpdated`**: Dispatched when customers are created, updated, or deleted
3. **`settingsUpdated`**: Already existed for settings changes

### Event Flow

```
Component A (e.g., QuickPOS) 
    ↓ Creates Transaction
    ↓ Dispatches 'transactionUpdated' event
    ↓
Component B (e.g., Transactions Page)
    ↓ Listens for 'transactionUpdated' event
    ↓ Refreshes data automatically
```

## Benefits of the Fixes

### 1. Real-time Updates
- All pages now update automatically when data changes
- No need to manually refresh pages
- Consistent data across all components

### 2. Better User Experience
- Company admins can now access settings properly
- Immediate feedback when operations complete
- Seamless navigation between pages

### 3. Data Consistency
- All components stay in sync
- No stale data issues
- Reliable state management

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Company Admin Access
1. Login as a company admin
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Verify access is granted (should not redirect to unauthorized)

### 2. Test Transaction Updates
1. Create a transaction in QuickPOS or Sales
2. Navigate to Transactions page
3. Verify the new transaction appears immediately

### 3. Test Customer Updates
1. Add/update/delete a customer
2. Navigate to Customers page
3. Verify changes appear immediately

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event System Architecture
- Uses browser's native CustomEvent API
- Lightweight and performant
- No external dependencies required
- Cross-component communication

### Error Handling
- All event listeners are properly cleaned up
- Try-catch blocks around data operations
- Graceful fallbacks for failed operations

### Performance Considerations
- Events are only dispatched when necessary
- Event listeners are properly removed on component unmount
- No memory leaks from event listeners

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Centralized Event Management
- Consider implementing a centralized event bus
- Add event logging for debugging
- Implement event queuing for offline scenarios

### 2. Real-time Database Sync
- Consider implementing WebSocket connections
- Add real-time database synchronization
- Implement optimistic updates

### 3. Advanced Authorization
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Add permission-based UI rendering
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

## Conclusion

These fixes resolve the core issues with:
1. **Authorization**: Company admins can now properly access settings
2. **Data Updates**: All pages now update in real-time when data changes
3. **User Experience**: Seamless navigation and immediate feedback

The event-driven architecture provides a scalable solution for component communication and ensures data consistency across the application.
