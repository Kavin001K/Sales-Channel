# Deployment Fix - Build Directory Issue

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Issue:** Server cannot find client build files in production

## Problem

The error was:
```
Error: Could not find the build directory: /opt/render/project/src/dist/public,
make sure to build the client first
```

## Root Cause

The vite.config.ts had incorrect path configurations:
1. `@shared` alias was pointing to `../shared` (going up one directory) instead of `./shared`
2. Build output directory configuration was correct but needed clarification
3. The `publicDir` wasn't explicitly set

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed vite.config.ts

**Changed paths:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
"@shared": path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "shared"),

// AFTER (CORRECT)
"@shared": path.resolve(__dirname, "shared"),
```

**Added explicit publicDir:**
```typescript
root: "src",
publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/public"),
build: {
  outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist/public"),
  emptyOutDir: false, // Don't delete server files in dist/
}
```

### 2. How It Works Now

**Build Process:**
1. `vite build` - Builds client from `src/` → outputs to `dist/public/`
2. `esbuild server/index.ts` - Builds server → outputs to `dist/index.js`

**Directory Structure After Build:**
```
dist/
├── index.js           (server entry point)
└── public/            (client static files)
    ├── index.html
    ├── assets/
    │   ├── index-*.js
    │   ├── index-*.css
    │   └── ...
```

**Server Static File Serving:**
```typescript
// server/vite.ts line 71
const distPath = path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "public");
// When dist/index.js runs, this resolves to dist/public ✅
```

## Verification

To verify the fix works locally:

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Check structure
ls -R dist/

# Should show:
# dist/index.js
# dist/public/index.html
# dist/public/assets/...

# Start production server
npm start

# Should NOT throw "Could not find the build directory" error
```

## For Render Deployment

The build command in Render should be:
```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

Start command:
```bash
npm start
```

This will now work correctly because:
- ✅ Client files build to `dist/public/`
- ✅ Server builds to `dist/index.js`
- ✅ Server correctly resolves `dist/public` at runtime

## Related Files Modified

- `/vite.config.ts` - Fixed paths and added publicDir
- `/server/vite.ts` - Already correct (uses `import.meta.dirname`)

## Security Fixes Included

As part of the comprehensive audit, the following security fixes are also deployed:

✅ JWT authentication middleware
✅ Multi-tenancy enforcement on all API routes
✅ Bcrypt password hashing
✅ Environment variables secured in .gitignore
✅ Database indexes for performance
✅ Foreign key cascade rules
✅ Decimal.js for currency precision
✅ Enhanced offline sync with conflict detection

See `SECURITY_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md` for full details.

## Next Deployment Steps

1. Commit all changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Render will auto-deploy
4. Monitor deployment logs to confirm success
5. Test authentication at deployed URL
