# Netlify Deployment Fix - Sass Error Resolution

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was failing with a Sass plugin error, even though the project doesn't use Sass.

## Root Cause
Netlify was trying to process CSS files as if they were Sass files, causing build failures.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Sass as a Dev Dependency
- Added `sass: "^1.71.0"` to `package.json` devDependencies
- This ensures the Sass processor is available during build

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration
- Enhanced `vite.config.ts` with explicit CSS processing configuration
- Added build options to ensure proper CSS handling
- Configured asset file naming for CSS files

### 3. Added .npmrc Configuration
- Created `.npmrc` file with proper package installation settings
- Ensures compatibility with Netlify's build environment

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added sass dependency
- `vite.config.ts` - Enhanced CSS and build configuration
- `.npmrc` - Package manager configuration

## Verification Steps
1. Ensure all changes are committed to the repository
2. Push changes to trigger a new Netlify deployment
3. Monitor the build logs for any remaining errors

## Expected Result
The build should now complete successfully without Sass-related errors, as the necessary dependencies and configurations are in place.

## Additional Notes
- The project uses Tailwind CSS, not Sass
- CSS files are processed as regular CSS, not preprocessed
- The sass dependency is included only to satisfy Netlify's build requirements
